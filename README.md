Work in Progress!

The Open Food Facts (OFF) is a collaborative project where individual can contribute by adding data from the food products they buy. 
This project is a practice for visualization and classification specificaly on chocolate products.

Here is the list of ideas, questions I wanted to investigate:

- As any chocolate lover knows, there are several types of chocolate bar based on the amount of actual cocoa in the product. My hypothesis is that those categories should have a direct influence on the nutrition values (fat, carbohydrates, protein, etc.). Hence the first idea is to create a model to classify the different types of chocolate bars.
- Based on the identified types, see the distribution for the nutrients and the prevalence of certain categories by brands.
- Map the countries of origin with a visual for the number of product of that origin.
- Map the dominant type of chocolate for each consumer country.
